metrics from MQTT topics and publishing them to Prometheus for monitoring purposes.

##Functionality##

    *Connects to MQTT topics within the MQTT broker.
    *Collects metrics related to MQTT messages, connections, and other relevant statistics from the $SYS/# topic.
    *Publishes collected metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.


##Summary##

related to MQTT messaging and connections from the $SYS/# topic. It integrates seamlessly with 
Prometheus for monitoring and alerting purposes, ensuring visibility into the MQTT messaging environment's performance and health.
