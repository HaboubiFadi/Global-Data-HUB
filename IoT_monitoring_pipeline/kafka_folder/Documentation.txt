Docker Compose Overview

This Docker Compose file orchestrates multiple services for a data streaming and monitoring pipeline. It defines services for Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Zookeeper, Kafka broker, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, all connected to an external Kafka network.
Services Overview

    *Prometheus: Collects metrics and monitors the system.
    *Alertmanager: Handles alerts sent by Prometheus.
    *Grafana: Visualizes and analyzes metrics.
    *Zookeeper: Coordinates distributed applications.
    *Kafka Broker: Handles the distributed streaming platform.
    *MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data.
    *PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing data.

#Notable Configuration##

    *Zookeeper:
        EXTRA_ARGS: Specifies additional Java agent options for monitoring with JMX exporter.

    *Kafka Broker:

        KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: Enables auto-creation of topics.
        KAFKA_OPTS: Specifies additional Java agent options for monitoring with JMX exporter.

    *MongoDB:
        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME, MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: Credentials for initial database setup.
        MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: Specifies the initial database to be created.

    *PostgreSQL:
        POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Credentials and initial database setup.

##Summary##

This Docker Compose file configures a comprehensive environment for data streaming and monitoring, including services for data collection, storage, and visualization. Kafka is used as the messaging backbone, while MongoDB and PostgreSQL serve as storage solutions.
Notable configurations include settings for monitoring with JMX exporter and initial database setup credentials for MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
