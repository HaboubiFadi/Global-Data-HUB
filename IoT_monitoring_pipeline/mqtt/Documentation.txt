##Summary

This Docker Compose file sets up an MQTT messaging environment with an eclipse-mosquitto broker and a custom MQTT exporter. The exporter connects to MQTT topics, collects metrics, and publishes them to Prometheus for monitoring. Configuration, data, and log directories are mapped for persistence. 
Additionally, the services are connected to an external Kafka network for communication.
